== Dreams ==
 * ability to load only a single or range of cues, groups, subs, patch, macros, effects from a saved show (and have it track (or not)).

 * pass variables to macros, ie: current cue, latest channel selected, default fade times. so you could write a macro like:
{{{
GROUP 1 RECORD CUE <thisCue> LAST PART 7 TIME 6 WAIT <time of cue before $thiscue> ENTER
}}}

 * do math on the command line. examples:
{{{
CUE 1 > 7 TIME +4 ENTER
GROUP 4 @ +20 ENTER
CHAN 1 > 100 STEP 2 @ 50 ENTER     (every second channel between 1 and 100)
GROUP 6 ON @ +20 ENTER        (every channel that's on in group 6 up by 20, swiped from Strand)
CHAN 5 @ /70 ENTER   (puts chan 5 @ 70% of current level)
}}}
 * other whacky stuff on the command line
{{{
RECORD CUE 6 > 10 ENTER
GROUP 1 @ GROUP 2 ENTER
GROUP 2 > GROUP 4 @ FULL ENTER  (calls group 2 and group 3 and group 4)
GROUP 1 @ CUE 5 ENTER
GO TO CUE NEXT ENTER  
CHAN 4 @ 50 TIME 7 ENTER  (who needs sneak?)
GROUP 1 > 6 RECORD SUB 1 > 6 ENTER
CUE 1 > 4 RECORD GROUP 1 > 4 ENTER
}}}
 * fanning
{{{
CHAN 1 > 10 @ FAN 40 > FULL ENTER
CUE 6 PART 1 > CUE 6 PART 12 TIME FAN 2 > 24 ENTER
}}}
 * effects - able to load effects into subs, or run them in cues

 * affect subs from the command line (faders could be "motorized")
{{{
SUB 1 @ FL ENTER
SUB 2 @ 50 TIME 5 ENTER
SUB 1 > 10 @ 0 ENTER
}}}
